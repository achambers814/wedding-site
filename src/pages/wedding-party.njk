          <strong>Austin Chambers</strong>
          <br>
          Alissa's brother
          <br><br>
          Alissa has known Austin his whole life; Eric met Austin in 2012. Austin was ordained by Universal Life Church in 2014
          for Adam and Alisa's wedding. Since then, he has "threatened" marriage on us whenever we get in a disagreement.
          Austin knows us together and separately better than anyone else. He's a concert lover with Alissa and a board game nerd
          with Eric. Austin has been calling Eric his brother-in-law for years, and now he gets to be the one to make it
          official!

          I've known Ashlee my whole life. I’ve always said that I was born with my best friend waiting for me.
          She's the only person that could <em>potentially</em> beat me at Dr. Mario.
          I'm going to vote her most likely to cry during the wedding, but she could surprise me!

          <strong>Katie Bennett, Bridesmaid</strong>

          Alissa's friend

          Katie and I met in the roommate lottery our freshman year of college at UNC Charlotte. We sure hit the jackpot!
          We bonded over music when we were 18, and we still do at whatever age we are now. We'll try to keep the sing-alongs
          to a minimum at the wedding.

          Caroline and I met through Katie and became close friends once we spent time together as bridesmaids in Katie’s wedding.
          She's got an infectious laugh and I'm looking forward to seeing her dance moves at the wedding. (Just picture Kristen
          Wiig in <em>Bridesmaids</em>!)

          Amanda and I met at work and progressed from “work friends” to “friends friends.” She's my longest-distance friend
          and she's always up for an adventure. Here's to hoping she doesn't spill as many drinks at the wedding as she
          did on New Year's Eve.

          Theresa and I met through Ashlee and became friends after Theresa crashed several family events. She's the crazy
          dog lady to my crazy cat lady. Thankfully, her dogs won't kill me like my cats would her (allergies!). Her dog,
          Arya, is the only animal I've considered allowing in the wedding party.
